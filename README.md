# Calculator

A simple calculator web application built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS. This project intentionally avoids using the built-in `eval()` function in JavaScript to provide me the challenge and a more controlled approach to expression evaluation.

## Technologies Used

- [**React**](https://react.dev/): A JavaScript library for web and native user interfaces. Build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components written in JavaScript.
- [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev/): A fast, opinionated frontend build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- [**TailwindCSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.
- [**Jest**](https://jestjs.io/): A delightful JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity.
